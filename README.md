# Angular Music Player App

A modern, symmetrical square music player built with Angular 20, featuring a beautiful grey-blue aesthetic and responsive design.

## Features

🎵 **Modern Design**: Symmetrical 600x600px square layout with glass morphism effects  
🎛️ **Queue Panel**: Interactive queue with album art thumbnails  
🎮 **Player Controls**: Play/pause, next/previous, progress bar, and volume control  
🎨 **Animations**: Rotating vinyl effect and smooth transitions  
📱 **Responsive**: Adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining square aspect ratio  
🔊 **Audio Service**: Reactive audio management with RxJS observables  

## Development Server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
